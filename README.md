A sandbox for the Cooper Research Group.

*You can use this repository to test out Github without worrying about screwing it up!*

If you have no idea where to start, follow this to-do on your own Github Account:
- [This project was built by following the GitHub helloworld guide.](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- In case you are wondering, the .md file type is called **Markdown**.
